This project demonstrates how a firewall controls and protects data transmission across a network by simulating real-world scenarios using Netcat and iptables on Linux.
The simulation helps visualize how firewall rules (DROP and REJECT) affect the three core principles of cybersecurity â€” Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).
In this experiment, we used a simple client-server model where data is transferred using netcat (nc).
A firewall configured with iptables was applied to observe how network traffic behaves under different rule sets.
